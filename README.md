Purpose of Our Website!
============
As a user you want to find events in your area or maybe somewhere you are visiting. You also want to know how covid is affecting the area hosting those events. Well on this website you can type in the city where you'd like to attend an event. Then you also type the state that city is in, and select a certain type of event. Then once submitted you will see a list of dates with events and also the current number of covid cases that are new that day and how many total for the year. You can also click the link with the event and be brought to Ticket Master to buy tickets! Your searches will locally store to so you dont have to research them.


Experience Building the Website!
============
First We started with seperating into 2 person groups. 1 group focused on the html and the other started with getting the api calls providing a response. Andrew and Louis both took a look into Bulma the css framework we decided to use. They got a basic outline of our html built. Which was orginally going to be 2 seperate html's but we decided later to do 1. While they where doing that Juno and Hunter worked on our api calls. Hunter tackled the ticket master and Juno tackled the narrativa which we used for our covid cases. Once both of those where done we needed to establish variables to catch user input and insert them in our api calls. Andrew added I'ds and Hunter made a variable for them and made a submit button function that called on our api's and Hunter made a function for if you hit enter as well. Louis started working on appending the responses to our html, and Juno did that for his api call. once that was finished Hunter started working on our local storage and with the combined efforts of Louis we were able to that working. Once that was done we started doing a little styling and Juno went to work on fixing an issue where you can search anything and get results. All that was made ended being reverted because we broke our code which was the biggest issue we faced.
